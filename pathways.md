# Pathways
## A hyperflexible tabletop game

# Character Creation

## Statistics and Other Numerical Things
Your character is first defined by 7 stats, each of which represents what they rely on to solve problems:

- **STRength**: Overwhelming force; direct action; carrying the weight
- **DEXterity**: Precision and grace; exploiting a weakness; swift resolution
- **CONstitution**: Mountain-like endurance; unbreakable resolve; the plow-turned-sword
- **INTelligence**: A mind like a library; distant connections; power through understanding
- **WISdom**: Immovable calm; shedding complexity; revelation of the obvious
- **CHaRisma**: Bravado and showmanship; dazzling your audience; tell the story you want told
- **BALance**: Steady footing and strong will; holding your ground; stand against the storm

You have 10 points to distribute among these stats. BAL has a special use; it affects your Starting Stanza Points in combat. You'll learn about how to use Stanza Points in the section on Rolling Dice.

In addition, your character starts at level 1. Your character's HP is equal to the sum of all their stats (in other words, 10 at character creation). Your Starting Stanza Points, or Starting SP, is equal to BAL plus your Level. Your SP Cap is equal to the sum of all your stats, multiplied by 2--so, for a level 1 character, it'll be 20.

In addition, you should make room for three pieces of Equipment, as well as for a list of any Usable Items you might gather over the course of your journey.

## Paths and Blazes

Finally, the most important part of character creation is picking your PATHS. You will start with 2 Paths, which define what form your character's struggle takes, both in and out of combat. A good Path is not only useful on the battlefield, but also provides benefits outside of combat!

Each Path is defined by the following traits:
1. The name of the Path;
2. What stat you use as a bonus when rolling to use the Path, and
3. What stat your target uses as a bonus when rolling to defend against you.

These are the two most important elements; this is all you will have at the start. Leave some extra space around each Path for future advancement.

**Unless the GM gives you permission, you cannot use BAL as the bonus stat for a Path.** You may, however, use BAL as the 'target' stat.

As an example, a Knight Path might look something like this:
> Knight
> You attack with 1d8+STR. The target defends with 1d8+CON.

Note that you may also use a Path defensively; more on this in the Rolling Dice section.

## The Finishing Touches
Your character will also likely need a name. While some games advise you to pick a name early in the process, I find it easier to pick a good name once I already have a good idea of who the character is.

You may also wish to take notes on other details, like a character's physical appearance, their preferred weapon, the people they associate with and the causes they fight for. Feel free to do so, but be sure to leave space for keeping track of things like important objects, new Paths, and other bookkeeping.

# Rolling Dice and Settling Conflicts

One must always deal with uncertainty in life. In this game, it takes the form of dice. You will want a full set of dice--six-sided through 20-sided--but early on, you'll primarily be using the d6 and the d8.

By default, when rolling dice, you roll a d8. Under certain circumstances, you may roll additional dice, which may be of other sizes; this mostly applies to Blazes and Equipment (more on those in their own sections). For now, bear in mind that the d8 is the standard dice size.

## When Attacking
Your character will face adversaries. When they do, you may wish to fight those enemies, and will likely use a Path to do so. Fighting your foes does not always mean physical combat; sometimes you are competing in a sport of some kind, or partaking in a battle of wits, or trying to come up with a particularly well-written diss track on the fly. Whatever form conflict takes, characters take turns either *attacking their target's SP* or *using their SP to deal HP damage*. You only roll dice while attacking someone's SP.

To Attack a target's SP, choose a Path. The Path will tell you what dice and stat you attack with, and what dice and stat your opponent defends with. For instance, if we used the Knight path from the character creation section, we would roll 1d8 and add our STR to it, and our target would roll 1d8 and add their CON to it. Your opponent may get to roll additional dice if they have an applicable Path (see the section on Defending below).

At this point, before the dice are rolled, both you (the attacker) and your target (the defender) get a chance to trigger Blazes. These can do things like add dice to your rolls (i.e., +1d8), improve the result if the attack hits (written as +X Hit), get additional stats involved (i.e., +CHA), or trigger more complex effects. For more on Blazes, check the Advancement section.

Finally, roll the bones. Compare the sum of your dice and stats to the sum of your opponent's dice and stats. If the attacker's dice are higher, the attacker gains SP equal to the difference, and the defender loses SP equal to the difference. Bear in mind that you cannot have more SP than your SP Cap, and cannot have less SP than zero. If an attack would do SP damage to a character who has no SP, this triggers a Crescendo (also known as a Critical). This has two effects: first, it applies a -1 penalty to the stats the target used in defense for the rest of the encounter, and second, all of your teammates gain SP equal to what you just gained. Once a character has been struck with a Crescendo, they cannot be affected by another Crescendo until they've taken a turn.

## When Defending
You will find yourself on the receiving end of attacks. However, if you are defending with a stat that you have a matching Path for, you can improve your defense with it, as well as trigger Blazes.

When you are attacked, your attacker will tell you what stat you are using to defend. For instance, an enemy might use this Path to attack our Knight:
> Boxer
> You attack with 1d6+DEX. The target defends with 1d8+STR.

Normally, you would simply roll a d8 and add your STR. However, because you have a Path that uses STR, you can use your attack dice from that Path alongside the normal defense dice--in this case, you'd be rolling 2d8, dramatically improving your odds. You'd also be able to trigger any Blazes you have under the Knight Path (see Advancement).

## Dealing HP Damage
Instead of a regular SP attack, you may choose to cash in your SP to do damage to a target's HP. **This does not require a roll**. Simply declare that you are attacking the target's HP, and spend 2 SP per point of damage you want to inflict.

Certain pieces of equipment may add "Armor". This is subtracted from the damage you do when targeting an enemy's HP. You can also think of it as requiring you to spend a certain amount of damage up-front before doing actual damage. For instance, a piece of equipment that has Armor 1 would subtract 1 damage from any HP attack, meaning you'd need to spend at least 4 SP to cause permanent damage.

Some very powerful equipment may instead grant "Resistance". Resistance increases the cost of damage against that target by 1 SP. Each piece of equipment can only grant 1 Resistance, and no piece of equipment grants both Armor and Resistance. As an example, wearing a single piece of equipment with Resistance would mean that enemies have to spend 3 SP for each point of damage they want to deal to you. This may seem like a small effect, but it adds up rapidly.

## Supporting Your Allies

You may *also* transfer your SP to an ally. **This also does not require a roll.** Simply declare that you are 'supporting' an ally, and give them some of your SP. SP is transferred at a 1-to-1 rate, up to an amount equal to your BAL. In other words, a character who intends to play a support role in conflicts should spend points improving their BAL so that they may act as a more effective anchor for the party.

## Cross Paths

Working together can create openings where a lone warrior cannot succeed. When you combine your efforts with another party member to achieve a goal, this is known as a "Cross Path", or X-Path.

To use a Cross Path, you must ask one of your allies to help you. If they agree, they skip their next turn in combat.

If they agree to perform a Cross Path, then you must both choose a Path to attack with, and decide which of those Paths the defender will get their dice from. You and your partner both roll, as if you are both performing regular SP attacks at the same time, and you combine the rolls to get the final result. However, you cannot use Blazes (unless otherwise stated; see Advancement). **Your opponent only rolls the defense dice from ONE of the two Paths you used.** 

This has potential to not only do more SP damage than a regular attack, but also to do damage to enemies that neither of you could hurt on your own.

## "Attacking" inanimate objects, and other challenges

You will deal with inanimate objects and other skill challenges in the same way that you deal with foes on the battlefield. Instead of an active opponent who fights back, you will "attack" the challenge itself, which will have stats, HP, and Paths as determined by the GM. You can use any Path to deal with an obstacle, so long as the GM rules it acceptable.

To defeat an obstacle, deplete its HP. As per usual, you spend 2 SP to remove 1 HP. The GM will tell you how much HP the obstacle has. They are not required to tell you anything else about the obstacle, but they should take care to give the obstacle stats that make sense given their description of it.

When you attack an inanimate object, **it never rolls dice**. Inanimate objects also **cannot attack**, neither to take SP nor to destroy HP. Inanimate objects do not have a will or the ability to fight back, and as such, they are inherently easier to deal with than a moving opponent. Objects *can*, however, have Blazes and SP--and they can trigger a Blaze under the same conditions that any character could. The GM can--and should--use this to create traps and other interesting interactions.

When attacking an inanimate object, you are not considered to be in combat (unless you're trying to attack an object in the middle of a regular fight). As such, you may change your equipment at will. The GM may rule that your time is limited at their discretion, however, so don't expect them to let you juggle your items forever if you're currently falling off a cliff.

## Rolling without a Path

Sometimes you may want to use one of your stats without an appropriate Path to support it. In these cases, you roll 1d8 plus that stat as normal, but two caveats apply: firstly, your target may choose any stat to defend with--and will likely choose one that grants them use of a Path and additional dice--and secondly, you cannot score Crippling Blows against your target when you are rolling without a Path.

# Advancement

## Gaining Levels
You gain a Level whenever your GM decides that you have performed a suitably impressive act. Early on, you may gain a level simply for surviving a battle against a dangerous foe, but as you grow more powerful the GM may require you to seek mightier obstacles to grow. Your GM may also award levels for growing as a character, or for resolving part of your character's story.

The GM should grant Levels for great feats to all participating characters, and Levels for good roleplay to the characters who were involved in the roleplay. Take care not to create too large a level disparity within the party.

When you gain a level, you get 2 Stat Boosts to use on your stats, and one Path Boost to use on your Paths. You will also need to recalculate your Starting SP--each Level increases it by 1.

## Stat Boosts
Each Stat Boost increases a stat by 1 point. You can spend both Stat Boosts on one stat, or spend each of them on separate stats.

When you spend a Stat Boost, you will have to recalculate your HP and your SP Cap; each Stat Boost increases your HP by 1 and your SP Cap by 2. If you spent your Stat Boost on BAL, you will also have to recalculate your Starting SP; each point of BAL improves your Starting SP by 1.

You do not have to spend Stat Boosts right away. If you really want to, you can save them for later. There isn't anything to be gained by holding onto them forever, though.

## Path Boosts and Blazes
A Path may have *Blazes*, additional features that grant new ways of using the Path. You can gain one of these by spending Path Boosts.

A Blaze is defined by the following traits:
1. The name of the Blaze;
2. The cost of using the Blaze;
3. The effect that triggers when the cost is paid.

Blazes may be triggered at any time, so long as the Path they belong to can be applied to the situation. In general, **if you are using the same stat that the Path uses, you can use Blazes from that Path.** Put another way, any time you would be able to attack or defend with a Path, you can use Blazes from it.

As an example, a Blaze added to the Knight Path from the character creation section might look something like this:
> Knight
> You attack with 1d8+STR. The target defends with 1d8+CON.
>
> - Selfless Valor: You may spend 2 SP to add 1d8 to your next roll.

In this case, you would be able to trigger Selfless Valor any time you're rolling with STR as a bonus, even on defense.

Work with the GM to determine the cost of the Blaze. The following table is a guideline for what kinds of effects are available and what kinds of costs are appropriate for them:

|SP Cost|OR|Stat Cost|Effect|
|---|---|---|---|
|1 SP||Temporary -1|Temporary -1 to a target stat|
|1 SP||Temporary -1|Add a d4|
|2 SP||Temporary -2|Add a d6|
|3 SP||Permanent* -1|Add a d8|
|3 SP||Permanent* -2|Add +1 Hit|
|1 SP||Permanent* -1|Each additional +1 Hit after the first|
|4 SP||Permanent* -3|Add a d10|
|5 SP||Permanent* -4|Add a d12|
|10 SP||Permanent* -5|Add a d20|
|10 SP||N/A|Add another stat|

\* Here, "permanent" means that the penalty stays until the end of the encounter.

## Gaining new Paths

Gaining a new Path is not as simple as gaining a new Blaze. Paths represent training, specialization, and lifelong investment in a particular craft or profession; you should only gain a new Path when your character has grown significantly, or has begun training under another character to learn a new skill.

If you want to gain a new Path, talk to your GM about it. Explain what you're looking for--both in terms of what you want the new Path to do, and in terms of the story you want to tell about how your character starts this new chapter of their life. Your GM will set a specific goal for your character--perhaps defeating a specific kind of enemy, or succeeding on an attack using the stat that your new Path will use, or performing a certain task for your teacher. You should write this down, because it should take at least a couple sessions to do this. Once you have achieved this goal, you may add the Path to your character sheet. You may also Level Up in the process, but this is not guaranteed.

Sometimes, the GM may grant you a Path as a consequence of the story. This should be used sparingly.  Your GM will inform you of the details of the Path you just gained; it becomes available for use immediately.

Very rarely, usually for reasons specific to your character, one of your Paths may *change*. **The GM should warn you immediately if something you are about to do has consequences for one of your Paths**. The classic example of this would be a Paladin falling from grace, but there may be many reasons for a Path to change. In any case, when a Path changes, **you lose access to all Blazes from the old Path**, and must start building the new one from scratch. Be sure to keep a copy of your old Path on hand; if for any reason you regain access to it, you immediately regain all of your old Blazes as well.

# Equipment and other Items of importance

## Types of objects

Objects in Pathways are divided into three broad categories:

1. Objects which have no gameplay effect (Background Items)
2. Objects which have a gameplay effect when "used" (Items)
3. Objects which have a gameplay effect when "equipped" (Equipment)

The key difference is in when and how the object has an effect.

## Background Objects

Most things in Pathways can be categorized as Background Objects. This means that they have no effect on the numbers, and exist mostly for the sake of flavor. For instance, your character does not start with any Equipment, but this does not mean they are not wearing clothes! The beers your warrior drinks at the tavern may not be remarkable in any way, but they still exist for the sake of singing drinking songs loudly while your party watches in shock and embarrassment. Your sword may not grant you a +1 to your attacks, but for the sake of streamlining things, anyone who would fight with a sword is assumed to have one.

More specifically, **any time your character would reasonably have something, but doesn't have a *special* version of that thing, they have a Background Object**. Your Warrior does not start with a magic sword, but they *do* start with a sword, and it is a Background Object. Your Paths have an effect on this; a Knight tends to have a sword, but a Blacksmith might have a hammer instead, and a Bard certainly doesn't use blades (though he might have a knife just in case). Similarly, a Knight would probably not have a gun, unless he's also a Musketeer.

Your GM may rule in certain special cases that you don't have access to things you would normally be carrying. For instance, a character who has recently been captured and imprisoned was probably already stripped of his weapons. The GM will explain how this affects you, but in most cases, this will *also* restrict you from properly using some of your Paths; a Knight is trained in fighting with longsword and polearm, but it is hard to use a longsword technique without a longsword.

## Usable Items

The other common class of items is those which have an effect upon being "used". This includes both consumable items, like potions and magic scrolls, as well as objects which can be used repeatedly, like keys or wands.

More specifically, **any time your character must perform a specific action to gain an effect from an object, they have a Usable Item**. You must *drink* a potion to enjoy its benefits (or regret its side-effects); you must *use* a key to unlock the matching door; you must *wave* a wand to cast its spell.

This has a subtle and important distinction from Background Objects, in that Usable Items have *specific* effects--that is, they have numbers attached. All Usable Items will have some text describing their effect. For example:

> Potion of Healing: Drink to recover 5 HP, then discard this item.

This is different from the way that some Background Objects are used as part of Paths. A hammer and forge might be necessary for a Blacksmith to forge a new blade, but neither the hammer nor the forge have the effect attached to them--the effect is attached to the Path, not the Background Objects it uses. Meanwhile, a Potion of Healing always has its effect, no matter who picks it up.

Some Usable Items end their effect with "discard this item". This means that the item stops existing after it is used. For the sake of simplicity, things like potions cannot be split among multiple users (unless the potion specifies that it contains multiple doses, or another effect grants you the power to share the effect).

## Equipment

Finally, the most interesting--and potentially most powerful--class of item. Equipment is defined by what it does while you are wearing, wielding, or otherwise prepared to use it. This includes armor, talismans, weapons, or even abstract concepts.

More specifically, **if you must prepare the item before a battle, and gain a passive benefit from it, it is Equipment**. A magic sword is only useful if you have it in your hand, and mithril chainmail is only going to protect the one who wears it.

Equipment is almost never consumed or destroyed. It takes extraordinary effort to *break* a sword, and modeling the wear and degradation of armor is beyond the scope of this game. Characters are assumed to be taking good care of their equipment, because most players do not want to roleplay every single swipe of a whetstone across a blade.

A piece of equipment will come with a piece of text listing its benefits. For example:

> Cold Iron Sword: +2 Hit on Paths that use STR or DEX.

This sword grants a bonus to the effect of your SP attacks, but only if you use it with a Path that uses STR or DEX--you cannot give this sword to a Bard and expect it to make him sing better. As a rule of thumb, Equipment that requires you to fulfill a condition of some kind will grant more powerful effects than Equipment that simply gives you the bonus upfront.

There is a hard limit of three pieces of Equipment in use for each character at any given time. You may *carry* more than this, but you may not *equip* more than three pieces of Equipment, meaning that you may not have the benefit of more than three pieces of Equipment at once. This represents the fact that each item your character is juggling in the heat of battle carries its own mental tax, as well as a physical tax in the form of keeping it in ready condition. There are no other hard restrictions, although your GM may rule that you cannot wear three full suits of plate armor at once.

Equipping a piece of Equipment can be done at any time outside of combat. If you want to equip something *during* combat, you must spend your turn doing so.

Some examples of bonuses that Equipment can provide include:

- Additional dice on rolls (i.e., +1d8)
- Additional SP damage on a succesful hit (i.e., +2 Hit)
- Armor, letting you ignore a few points of damage each turn (i.e., Armor 2)
- Resistance, increasing the cost of your foes' attacks by 1
- A bonus to a specific stat

The Equipment may require you to use a Path with a specific attack stat, or to have a stat above a certain amount, to gain the Equipment's bonus. Equipment may provide more than one bonus, but broadly speaking, it will either provide benefits to your attacks or to your defenses--not both, though in some cases your offense may *become* your defense.
