# Pathways

A tabletop RPG designed for flexibility and ease of play.

## Why?

Because D&D is the gold standard--but it's more of a gilded standard. It has an incredible amount of flexibility, as well as widespread support from a long history of fan-made content--but between overly-complex rules that handle everything as edge cases, a giant pile of sourcebooks of varying quality and balance standards, and a design that can't decide if it wants spellcasters to be utility or damage (and gives them both), D&D's age is showing. I wanted to build something with the flexibility of the d20 system, but with a more modern design philosophy of doing as much as possible with as little as possible.

## How do I get started?

The core rules are located in `pathways.md`. Go there for character creation, the basic combat rules, and information on how to make your character more powerful.

As I build examples, I'll expand this into an index of what information is in which files.
